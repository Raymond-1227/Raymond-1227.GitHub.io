# Raymond's Site

Ah v3 website is here! But well v2 website stays on and I might update sometimes.

---

## Versions

**v1**: Jekyll Templates, based on GitHub Pages and it's only a page with useless informations.

**v2**: VuePress Documentation, based on GitLab Pages, but with a lot of informations.

**v3**: Brizy, simplified the v2 by moving all project READMEs back to its own repository, and now it's only a single about page too.


## About v2

After finding out that my website isn't working on GitHub, instead I hosted on GitLab with the help by [@AdminRAT](https://github.com/AdminRAT).

**v2 Project Link**: [raymond-1227.gitlab.io](https://gitlab.com/raymond-1227/raymond-1227.gitlab.io)
