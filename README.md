# Raymond's Site
Ah v3 website is here! But well v2 website stays on and I might update sometimes.

---

## Versions
**v1**: Jekyll Templates, based on GitHub Pages and it's only a page with useless informations.

**v2**: Docusaurus (New) / VuePress (Old), based on GitLab Pages, but with a lot of informations.

**v3**: Brizy, simplified the v2 by moving all project READMEs back to its own repository, and now it's only a single about page too.


## About v2 Rebooted
Too lazy to find out what is causing reason of GitLab failing CI builds, so I made a new website based on Docusaurus.

**New v2 Project Link**: [raymond-2006/raymond-2006.github.io](https://github.com/raymond-2006/raymond-2006.github.io)

## About v2 Original
After finding out that my website isn't working on GitHub, instead I hosted on GitLab with the help by [@AdminRAT](https://github.com/AdminRAT).

**Old v2 Project Link**: [raymond-1227/raymond-1227.gitlab.io](https://gitlab.com/raymond-1227/raymond-1227.gitlab.io)
